1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,052
DNA sequencing machines produce large amount of "reads".

2
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:08,666
Each of them originates from a certain genome location.

3
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:12,053
If we analyse a known organism, we can

4
00:00:12,153 --> 00:00:14,754
compare the new data to a reference genome.

5
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:17,840
We will now show how to find where

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,158
each query read aligns in a reference.

7
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:23,193
We will use the A* shortest path

8
00:00:23,293 --> 00:00:26,614
algorithm to find optimal alignments very efficiently.

9
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,347
To direct the A-star search, we will

10
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,818
first divide the read into short seeds.

11
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:37,880
We will now match each seed to all its exact occurences and

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,762
mark the preceding reference positions with what we call bread crumbs. These

13
00:00:41,862 --> 00:00:44,980
crumbs will prove handy when we will want to know how promising

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,994
a certain direction is for bringing us to a best alignment.

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,928
In order to give the possibility to start our search from one

16
00:00:56,028 --> 00:00:59,584
place, we will aggregate the the whole reference into a trie index.
