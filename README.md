# Dependencies

* [manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim) -- Library for math visualizations
* [manim-voiceover](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim-voiceover) -- plugin for auto text-to-speech and subtitles

# TODO

* norm_play.py allows to proportionally stretch a group of animations to fill a stated duration. This allows to automatically stretch the animations to fill the whole duriation of the voiceover. It could be integrated into the main library or the voiceover plugin.
